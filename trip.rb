# Code your prompts here!

# First, puts out a string asking where the tourist would like to stay.
puts "Let's plan your trip! Where would you like to stay?"

# Then, set a variable called stay to get the user's input. Make sure to capitilize that input.

stay = gets.chomp.capitalize  #don't forget to Capitilize the input

# Do the same thing with `eats` and one last time with `nights`, capturing their text input and storing them to the respective local variable
puts "Where would you like to eat?"
eat = gets.chomp.downcase
puts "What sites would you like to visit"
sites = gets.chomp.capitalize
puts "How many nights would you like to stay?"
nights = gets.chomp.capitalize
# Lastly, puts it all back by interpolating these values in a string.

puts "You will stay at #{stay}, eat #{eat}, visit #{sites} and stay for #{nights} nights."
